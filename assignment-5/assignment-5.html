      Lone Eagle Peak has forever been imprinted in my mind as one of the most awe inspiring Peaks in Colorado. It stands proudly at 11,900’. Lone Eagle’s pointy summit is commanding and intimidating to the average hiker. To the enthusiastic adventure climber, it’s a veritable playground encapsulated in stone and surrounded by pristine, rugged beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      8 miles out into the Indian Peaks Wilderness, solitude and peace and quiet awaits. The approach out to the peak via the Monarch Lake trailhead, located just outside of Granby, CO, in itself can prove to be a splendid outing. Upon hiking out to the Peak one may encountered a mother moose and her young, deer, fox, snakes, sweet smelling wildflowers, beautiful swift flowing waterfalls, rushing streams, towering pines and beckoning rock faces. It is not uncommon to have a moose or two greet you at the trailhead parking lot. But be respectful. We are in their home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lone Eagle can be climbed semi technically (Class 4) or technically. The airy Class 4 route up Lone Eagle’s South side has deservingly earned it’s namesake, Solo Flight. Care should be used when crossing the saw tooth-like ridge to Lone Eagle’s summit. The faint at heart may choose to rope up on this section. Protection is available but take heed and test the rock for durability before protecting it. <strong>There is a lot of loose rock on the peak.</strong>

    <h2>Solo Flight</h2>

      <figcaption>Solo Flight Route</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This is the easiest route to the classic summit of Lone Eagle Peak and in reverse is also the descent from any route summiting Lone Eagle Peak (including Solo Flight itself). While "only" 4th Class, it is very exposed and features devious route finding on terrain that quickly exceeds 4th Class if a wrong turn is taken, which can easily happen despite the numerous cairns en route, especially when climbing the route for the first time in reverse after an ascent of the N. Face route. I won't say anything else about that other than if going in reverse, look in every direction for the next cairn, and don't misinterpret a random pile of rocks!! I excerpt here almost verbatim (differences in []'s) from Gerry Roach's description of Solo Flight, from the 1989 Indian Peaks Wilderness Area Guide. The differences are mostly because it seems to me that some of the directions were off. Also because if you try to follow directions too carefully on this climb, you have to enjoy being totally confused, so I'm trying to confuse you even more (e.g. just follow your nose).
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary>Full Route</summary>
      <p>
        From the northeast side of Crater Lake, climb southeast to a point just below the north face of Lone Eagle Peak. Continue climbing southeast and stay below the cliffs of Lone Eagle Peak's northeast face. The easiest going is actually right under the cliffs, and you may find some wonderful flower displays at the base of the rocks. It is also reasonable to hike across talus some distance below the cliffs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stay below the cliffs and continue south to a point where you can look down on Triangle Lake. It is 0.5 miles from the base of the north face to this point. It is not necessary to go to Triangle Lake, only to see it. The cliffs of Lone Eagle Peak finally start to relent, and the route ascends southwest up a ramp bordered on its north side by a dwindling cliff band. Look sharp for a good place to leave the ramp, and climb northwest (right) up through this cliff band. There are at least three places to ascend this cliff band with 50 feet of Class 3 climbing. Some cairns mark the upper two places.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you are above the dwindling cliff band, traverse north on a broad ramp. You are finally headed toward the summit instead of away from it! After 200 yards of traversing, do an ascending traverse northwest up broken ledges to a pair of small notches in the convoluted ridge. This ascending traverse follows the path of least resistance and involves an occasional Class 3 move. The two notches are [along a spur from the north-south ridge].
      </p>
      <p>
        The view north from the [southeast] notch can be disheartening at first, but at least you can finally see the summit. It is 250 yards north and below you. The summit is not the highest point on the ridge, but it is the farthest north. Climb [south] through the [southeast] notch, and descend 20 feet on the [southwest] side of the ridge (Class 3). Turn [northwest] (right), and climb 30 feet into another notch with a curious chockstone in it (Class 3).
      </p>
      <p>
        From here on, the route is exposed and more serious. There is a steep gully descending north from the notch with the chockstone in it. Get on the west side of this gully, traverse north, and descend slightly to a series of easy ledges 100 feet north of the notch (Class 3). There are at least two ways to accomplish this maneuver. These ledges are on the east side of the ridge running north toward the summit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traverse north 100 yards on the ledges (Class 3). When the ledges bump into cliffs, descend 70 feet east down a south-angling Class 4 pitch to a lower series of ledges. This pitch is the crux of the route and can be downclimbed or rappelled. If desired, a rope can be left in place on this pitch to aid the return trip.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traverse north 200 feet on the lower series of ledges (Class 3), and engage the single closed contour of the summit. Ascend 60 feet northwest across the east side of the summit ridge to the summit (Class 4). The job isn't complete until you tiptoe north 30 feet on the narrow ridge to the most spectacular point.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a complicated route, but take heart. It follows the path of least resistance, consists mostly of easy Class 3 scrambling, is festooned with cairns, and, most important of all, leads to an incredible summit.

    <h2>North Face</h2>

      <figcaption>North Face Route</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This moderate alpine rock route is classic both for the quality of the climbing and the sheer ambiance of the wall it tackles. The long approach to Lone Eagle Peak ensures solitude, and the cirque itself is unmatched for beauty in the entirety of the Indian Peaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the moniker, most of the climbing takes place on the east side of the peak. Scramble southeast up a steep grassy slope for 200 yards from Crater Lake to the base of the east face. The route starts from the talus field just over the crest -- look for a large, tree-filled bench.
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary>Full Route</summary>
      <p>
        P1. Climb wet black rock (5.4) past a pin, aiming between the two large trees on the bench.
      </p>
      <p>
        P2-4. Follow a 5.0 ramp up and south (climber's left), climbing over, around and through numerous trees en route. You can break this bit up or simul-climb. It's mostly 3rd and 4th class. It helped me to scope this bit out from the valley below and to the east of the peak, since only the final pitches are visible from Crater Lake.
      </p>
      <p>
        P5. The ramp ends at a grassy gully which splits the east face. Climb broken rock (5.3) straight up this cleft to the base of a deep, water-streaked chimney.
      </p>
      <p>
        P6. Climb the chimney (5.5), making use of the positive face holds on the right wall to get past a few tricky spots.
      </p>
      <p>
        P7-8. Grassy slopes interspersed with occasional rock steps (5.4) lead to the top of the cleft, which deposits you on a huge ledge system below the summit cliffs.
      </p>
      <p>
        P9. 3rd or 4th Class south up blocky ramps to reach the summit cliff band.
      </p>
      <p>
        P10. <strong>The crux!</strong> This 150-foot pitch follows [the rightmost] a pair of twin, [right-facing] cracks on the northwest-facing summit headwall, about 100 feet west of the prominent arete where the east and north faces meet. You will most likely need to move right and down from your last belay to reach the start of cracks. Don't be suckered into trying the diagonalling twin cracks closer to the arete -- it's off route. You'll know you're on route if you pass 4 old pins. [Angle] right from the top of the cracks past a spike [with two more pins following the easiest path]. Belay above on a huge ledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        P11. Move your belay about 100 feet south (left) along the ledge to the base of a left-angling 5.4 corner/chimney. With a 60 meter cord, you can reach the top of the peak in one pitch from here. When the chimney peters out, either belay or continue wandering up broken rock (choose your own adventure) to the summit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>P11 Alternate</em>. Take the striking hand crack up the center of the northeast face at 5.8. Per Stephen Becker: the farthest right crack is considerably harder. It takes solid pro with finger and hand jamming to a great ledge just below the summit. Per Stephen Becker: optionally belay here, or finish off the summit if you have a 60m. Optionally belay here, or finish off the summit if you have a 60m.

      <q>This climb is not as committing as one might think. Before the crux pitch, when one reaches the ridge, you can simply walk down scree slopes on the west side of the ridge. This is a good thing to keep in mind if thunderstorms threaten early, or you want to bypass the first 9 pitches of the climb for some reason.</q>

    <h2>Mohling Traverse</h2>
    <p>
      This sustained excursion (lots of 4th and easy 5th class) starts on the summit of Lone Eagle Peak (reached either via the North Face Route or Solo Flight) and traverses south along a spectacular ridge to the seldom-visited summit of Iriquois (12,799).
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary>Full Route</summary>
      <p>
        From the summit of Lone Eagle follow the Solo Flight route south to the one point at which it drops over a notch onto the west side of the ridge. Descend 100 feet west down a gully and continue up and south on a grassy, diagonalling bench below the ridgeline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stay on the west side of the ridge and summit "Limbo," a 12,420 spire two-thirds of the way along the traverse, via its north face. Descend Limbo to a notch below the north face of Iriquois (I flipped over to the east side of the ridge to do this; some parties may want to rappel).
      </p>
      <p>
        Climb Iriquois as best you can. The terrain is easier and more broken up on the west side of the north face.
      </p>
      <p>
        This traverse has numerous easy fifth-class sections and plenty of options for either increasing or decreasing the difficulty. It's possible to escape east toward Triangle Lake in a couple of spots should weather move in, but once on Iriquois itself you're fairly committed.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're camped at Crater Lake you can either reverse the traverse until it's possible to descend to Crater Lake or go west from Iriquois' summit over Hopi and down Achonee's southeast gully. Alternately, continue east along another tricky, jagged ridge to the summit of Apache and make your way back east toward Brainard Lake as best you can. I continued over Navajo and down Niwot Ridge for full flavor . . .
      </p>
