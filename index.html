        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Nanda Min-Fink. I am a junior at CU, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Creative Technolgy and Design. 
            I was born in Thailand and moved to Arlington, Virgina when I was 6. I love the outdoors, which was one of my main reasons coming to boulder,
        especially hiking and snowboarding.
