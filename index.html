        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Nanda Min-Fink, I am 20 years old and a student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am in my junior year, pursuing a major in Computer Science and a Minor in <abbr title="Creative Technology and Design">CTD</abbr>. My interest in computer science began through modding video games as a kid and as I continued to do small projects throughout high school I solidified my interest in the field. I am also intrigued in graphic design making this class a great blend of those two aspects. I am currently interning at a software programming company in Niwot working on back-end databases and authentication systems.
        </p>

            Outside of school I spend a lot of my time hiking, snowboarding, and playing Ultimate Frisbee. I recently have gotten into skiing and am in the process of making the switch from snowboarding to access the backcountry in Colorado. Overall, I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as possible regardless of the activity.
