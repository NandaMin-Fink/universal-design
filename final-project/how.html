        <h2>Universal Design Thinking</h2>
        <p> Design thinking is "the idea that the types
            of thinking and methods behind what we call user experience design
            benefit all types of decision making processes, and that applying design
            thinking broadly to challenges and opportunities will produce more
            successful outcomes."</p>

        <details>
            <summary>Integration and iteration</summary>
            <p>The full range of design is considered throughout the project, rather than focusing only on the surface layer to make an already conceived product appealing. The entire product is designed by imagining an array of possible approaches; and then, through an iterative process of prototyping and testing, homing in on the best approach based on feedback about the effectiveness of the design.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Divergent thinking</summary>
            <p>Imagine possibilities without constraints. All too often, accessibility solutions come down to code, without consideration of whether the overall design approach is the right one. Divergent thinking in the early phases of a project, exploring options for accessible designs, yields innovative designs that are also accessible.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Convergent thinking</summary>
            <p>Choose from all the ideas the ones that are
                     most likely to work, given the environment. This is also important for
                     accessibility: choosing among options the ones that best suit the web
                     environment and meet diverse needs.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Human centered</summary>
            <p>Design thinking is powered by an understanding
                of people’s wants, needs, and behaviors, which set the direction for
                a project, as well as feedback from people that helps refine solutions
                throughout the process.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Insight</summary>
            <p>To gain human centered insights, you need to understand
                what works best for people who access and operate the web in different ways. Ideally, this means observing people in their context,
                watching what they do, and hearing what they say. Stories also generate empathy, which feeds insight. In the next chapter, we’ll present
                personas that we believe will provide the information needed for
                empathy and insight, and that will inspire creative, divergent thinking about ways to provide accessible solutions.</p>
        </details>

        <p>Universal design can be integrated into design thinking by including accessibility in the process and thinking broadly about what different kinds of people will interact with your design. This allows one to design for a large diverse group of people that preemptively accounts from barriers such as disability and other access limitations or hindrances.</p>

        <h2>Mobile First Design</h2>
        <p>Mobile first design is a commitment to prioritizing the experience of an application or website for smaller, mobile screens before tackling larger screens such as a tablet or desktop. While it may not be immediately apparent, this plays a large role in how to carry out universal design. Mobile first design forces the designer to focus on the most simple features due to the limited nature of a smaller screen, removing any unnecessary complexities. Additionally, Universal Design advocates for design for a wide array of people and designing for mobile achieves this goal because not only is most of the internet accessed via mobile, but mobile design is also more accessible to lower-income regions where phones are often the only means of accessing the internet.</p>

        <h2>Following Web Semantics</h2>
        <h3>Accessible Forms</h3>
        <p>Forms are often used for essential parts of interacting with websites such as sign ups or checkouts. Semantically designed forms follow logical flow, are well labeled, allow one to navigate the form with a screen reader, and provide immediate visual feedback. </p>

        <h3>Skip Navigation</h3>
        <p>Skip Navigation links allow users to bypass the navigation or any other repetitive elements on a page. This is an essential feature for those using assistive technology such as a screen reader or keyboard navigation or even someone who has a broken mouse. By skipping the navigation, the users are able to save significant time and they aren’t forced to listen or tab through the same content every time they load a page. Skip navigation links should appear immediately and be visible to the user.</p>

        <h3>Specific Semantic Tags</h3>
        <p>Html5 includes a wide array of semantic tags that when used correctly improve the experience of all users. At the most basic level, making use of proper organization tags such as main, nav, aside, etc. makes site navigation considerably easier and predictable. Additionally, header tags help users know what information they are about to read or hear. Finally, there are more specific tags such as bold, mark, or abbr, that aid in clarifying or emphasizing information. All of these semantic tags are recognized by assistive technologies giving these users a better experience. </p>

        <h3>Responsive Structure</h3>
        <p>Responsive structures allow websites to adapt to all screen sizes. This allows them to not only be usable for phones, tablets, and computers, but also for those who rely on magnified views.</p>
