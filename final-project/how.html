        <h2>Following Web Semantics</h2>
        <h3>Accessible Forms</h3>
        <p>Forms are often used for essential parts of interacting with websites such as sign ups or checkouts. Semantically designed forms follow logical flow, are well labeled, allow one to navigate the form with a screen reader, and provide immediate visual feedback. </p>

        <h3>Skip Navigation</h3>
        <p>Skip Navigation links allow users to bypass the navigation or any other repetitive elements on a page. This is an essential feature for those using assistive technology such as a screen reader or keyboard navigation or even someone who has a broken mouse. By skipping the navigation, the users are able to save significant time and they arenâ€™t forced to listen or tab through the same content every time they load a page. Skip navigation links should appear immediately and be visible to the user.</p>

        <h3>Specific Semantic Tags</h3>
        <p>Html5 includes a wide array of semantic tags that when used correctly improve the experience of all users. At the most basic level, making use of proper organization tags such as main, nav, aside, etc. makes site navigation considerably easier and predictable. Additionally, header tags help users know what information they are about to read or hear. Finally, there are more specific tags such as bold, mark, or abbr, that aid in clarifying or emphasizing information. All of these semantic tags are recognized by assistive technologies giving these users a better experience. </p>

        <h3>Responsive Structure</h3>
        <p>Responsive structures allow websites to adapt to all screen sizes. This allows them to not only be usable for phones, tablets, and computers, but also for those who rely on magnified views.</p>
