        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Universal Design is an extension of accessible design principles. It incorporates all the aspects of making products, buildings, communications, etc. accessible to people with disabilities we see in accessible design. What makes Universal Design different is that it extends upon this idea by advocating for the widest number of users by preemptively figuring out how all kinds of people will interact with a design. Universal Design expects diverse users to be a consideration throughout the entire design process as opposed to an afterthought. The reality is that this form of design puts a burden on the designer but the return is a singular design that is dynamic and usable by all.</p>

        <h2>Web Standards</h2>
        <p>
            From a technical standpoint web standards are defined as using “structural languages like HTML, XHTML, and XML presentation languages like CSS, object models like the W3C DOM, and scripting languages like JavaScript.” (Beldman).
        </p>
        <p>
            More simply, this means using specific structure and elements that are recognized by standard-compliant browsers such as I.E.9+, Apple’s Safari 3.0+, Firefox 3+, Chrome, and Opera 9+
        </p>
        <p>
            Two specific components of web standards are splitting your site design into (x)HTML for structure and content, and CSS for styling and not using tables for layout purposes.

        <h3>Equitable Use</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.</li>
            <li>Example: Ensuring your website is screen reader compatible, includes alt text for images, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Flexibility in Use</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.</li>
            <li>Example: Accommodating a user with weak eyesight by allowing them to use their own high-contrast stylesheet to view text better.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Simple and Intuitive Use</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.</li>
            <li>Example: A form that includes clear labels, descends logically, and provides validation feedback for inputs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Perceptible Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.</li>
            <li>Example: A video on a website includes captions, a transcript, and sign language translations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Tolerance for Error</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.</li>
            <li>Example: A shopping website that allows one to undo actions and includes confirmation prompts before any purchases.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Low Physical Effort</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue.</li>
            <li>Example: Including a skip navigation feature to allow a user with a screen-reader to skip unnecessary information every time they access, refresh, or change pages.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Size and Space for Approach and Use</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility.</li>
            <li>Example: Responsive website design that adjusts for screen size so users can interact comfortably.</li>
        </ul>
